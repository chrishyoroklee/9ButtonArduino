# 9ButtonArduino

## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a digital musical instrument by building both hardware and software. My aim was to create a rather simple instrument with simple design, that has ability to create a variety of sounds by clicking on different combinations of the buttons. 
## Project
This project made use of both hardware and software, and Arduino with Aruduino Uno board was used as a connection between the hardware and the software.
The hardware was made using a breadboard, wires, buttons, resistors, alligator clips, and an Arduino Uno Board. 
The software was coded in C++ using the Arduino IDE.
