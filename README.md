# 9ButtonArduino

This is the Aruduino file in C++ for my 9-Button Synth.
## Project
This project made use of both hardware and software, and Arduino with Aruduino Uno board was used as a connection between the hardware and the software.
The hardware was made using a breadboard, wires, buttons, resistors, alligator clips, and an Arduino Uno Board. 
The software was coded in C++ using the Arduino IDE.
